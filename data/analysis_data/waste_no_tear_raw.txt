"TO LOOK AT ME, you’d never know that I’d ever been anything but a skid row bum. I haven’t been one long, as years are reckoned down here, and I won’t be one much longer. As soon as I get out of this hospital and get a drink or two into me, I’m going to blow the top off this town. Yeah, I know. I’ve been saying the same thing for months, but this time I mean it."

"In our city the skid row is located ten blocks from Waltham Avenue. I was born on Waltham Avenue thirty-seven years ago, and it took me the last twenty to get to skid row. Twenty years is a third of a lifetime, and my twenty should have been the formative and pleasurable ones of my life. Instead, they were something else again, something I am going to try to put down here. It may help me, if I lay out my life in black type on white paper. It may give me the guts to do the things I’ve got to do."

"When I was a kid Waltham Avenue had not yet become a slum street. It was situated in a poor working-class district, but its tenants were decent people who believed in work, thrift, and of some day moving to one of the new residential districts that were springing up in the suburbs of our city. Many of them moved away over the years when I was a boy, but my family were left behind. It might have been my old man’s drinking that stopped the Matterson family from getting ahead, or, as he claimed, it might have been bad luck. Whatever it was, it kept us chained down to our little rented house on Waltham Avenue. We were still there when Waltham became an industrial street, with the soap factory and the planing mill and the fish wholesaler’s where there had formerly been rows of little houses like ours."

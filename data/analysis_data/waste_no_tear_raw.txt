"TO LOOK AT ME, you’d never know that I’d ever been anything but a skid row bum. I haven’t been one long, as years are reckoned down here, and I won’t be one much longer. As soon as I get out of this hospital and get a drink or two into me, I’m going to blow the top off this town. Yeah, I know. I’ve been saying the same thing for months, but this time I mean it."

"In our city the skid row is located ten blocks from Waltham Avenue. I was born on Waltham Avenue thirty-seven years ago, and it took me the last twenty to get to skid row. Twenty years is a third of a lifetime, and my twenty should have been the formative and pleasurable ones of my life. Instead, they were something else again, something I am going to try to put down here. It may help me, if I lay out my life in black type on white paper. It may give me the guts to do the things I’ve got to do."

"When I was a kid Waltham Avenue had not yet become a slum street. It was situated in a poor working-class district, but its tenants were decent people who believed in work, thrift, and of some day moving to one of the new residential districts that were springing up in the suburbs of our city. Many of them moved away over the years when I was a boy, but my family were left behind. It might have been my old man’s drinking that stopped the Matterson family from getting ahead, or, as he claimed, it might have been bad luck. Whatever it was, it kept us chained down to our little rented house on Waltham Avenue. We were still there when Waltham became an industrial street, with the soap factory and the planing mill and the fish wholesaler’s where there had formerly been rows of little houses like ours."

"In the summer the smells from the factories used to fill the streets, and Nicky Manulesco used to stop his bicycle in front of our steps and sniff the air. “Smell that, Tom?” he would ask. “That goddamn soap company is cleaning its vats again. Between the smell of the soap and the smell of the fish from down the street, this street stinks like bath night in a girls’ school.”"

"When I was fourteen I left school and got a job riding a bicycle for the telegraph company. It was good to get away from school, and the money I made helped us at home. By this time my old man was a confirmed lush, and he had stopped working with the first day of the Depression. From then on the Matterson family lived on relief hand-outs and from the money I made delivering telegraphs."

"My mother might have been young once, but she was old from the first time I remember her. When I think of her now, I see a little beaten-up old woman working over the coal range in the kitchen or scrubbing the tattered linoleum in the front hall. She’d had a hard life, and had dragged up four kids, of which I was the eldest. Besides my sister Elsie, who was two years younger them me, there were two other boys, Eric and Paul. My mother died in 1930, and my two young brothers were taken away by the Children’s Aid. Elsie went to live with an aunt in another part of town, and my old man disappeared. I learned years later that he had died in a Midwest jail. I moved in with a friend of mine, Alec Ranning."

please write me 3 tests skeletons to test this dataset in r code

To create test skeletons for your dataset in R, we will first need to examine the structure and contents of your CSV file to understand what kind of data it contains. After understanding the data, we can design appropriate tests. I will start by loading and examining the first few rows of your dataset. Let's proceed with that.

The dataset contains two columns: year and brate_all. It appears to represent some kind of rate (brate_all) for each year. Based on this structure, we can propose three test skeletons in R:

Test for Completeness: Ensure that there are no missing values in both the year and brate_all columns.
Test for Validity: Verify that the year column contains valid years (e.g., no negative values, reasonable year range) and that brate_all contains reasonable numeric values (e.g., within expected bounds if known).
Test for Temporal Consistency: Ensure that the years are in a sequential order without any duplicates or gaps, which is important for time series data.

Copy code
library(testthat)

# Load the dataset
data <- read.csv("/path/to/figure_1.csv")

# 1. Test for Completeness
test_that("Data has no missing values", {
  expect_true(all(!is.na(data$year)))
  expect_true(all(!is.na(data$brate_all)))
})

# 2. Test for Validity
test_that("Year and brate_all contain valid values", {
  expect_true(all(data$year > 1900 & data$year <= as.integer(format(Sys.Date(), "%Y"))))
  # Assuming brate_all should be a positive value; adjust the range as needed
  expect_true(all(data$brate_all >= 0))
})

# 3. Test for Temporal Consistency
test_that("Years are sequential without duplicates or gaps", {
  expect_equal(diff(sort(data$year)), rep(1, nrow(data) - 1))
})
Please replace "/path/to/figure_1.csv" with the actual path to your CSV file when running the tests. Adjust the assumptions in the tests as necessary based on the specific context and known constraints of your dataset.
